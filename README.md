**Random Forest Algorithm:**.
This Algorithm builds a random forest using price indicators and classifies gold price accordingly.

The last part of the code plots one of the 10 trees generated by the algorithm. However, it takes time to run it.
You can see the tree here: LINK TO TREE PIC

**K-Means Algorithm** 
This algorithm is a simple unsupervised learning algorothim that classifies clients with respect to their spending and their income.
The algorithm, explores the difference between the elbow method and the silhouette method.
Those are methods for chosing the "best" number of clusters.

**Deep learning Algorithms**
Those are collections of algorithms I have used when learning deep learning.
I uploaded a simple deep learning algorithm that recognises the image of a cat (This algorithm is actually an assignment from Andrew ng's course ).
**I will be updating this section**
